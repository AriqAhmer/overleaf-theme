# Overleaf Theme

This is just a simple Overleaf LaTex editor inspired light theme. I was about to start wrtiting my research assignment when I thought of doing this instead (talk about procrastination!). Anyway, the main reason for creating this was to just make the editor look like Overleaf, because I don't like writing my articles in an online based editor if it's just solo work. I prefer to do it offline where I can have all the compile time in the world and not worry about running out of it.

**Anyway. I hope you enjoy it!**

PS: Feel free to fork and create a dark mode if you want to.
